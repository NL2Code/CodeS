The tool checks if a web server accepts HTTP/2 requests without downgrading them\n2. If the web server accepts and does not downgrade HTTP/2 requests the tool attempts to open a connection stream and subsequently reset it\n3. If the web server accepts the creation and resetting of a connection stream then the server is definitely vulnerable, if it only accepts HTTP/2 requests but the stream connection fails it may be vulnerable if the server-side capabilities are enabled.\n\nTo run,\n\n    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n    $ python3 cve202344487.py -i input_urls.txt -o output_results.csv\n\nYou can also specify an HTTP proxy to proxy all the requests through with the `--proxy` flag\n\n    $ python3 cve202344487.py -i input_urls.txt -o output_results.csv --proxy http://proxysite.com:1234\n\nThe script outputs a CSV file with the following columns\n\n- Timestamp: a timestamp of the request\n- Source Internal IP: The internal IP address of the host sending the HTTP requests\n- Source External IP: The external IP address of the host sending the HTTP requests\n- URL: The URL being scanned\n- Vulnerability Status: \"VULNERABLE\"/\"LIKELY\"/\"POSSIBLE\"/\"SAFE\"/\"ERROR\"\n- Error/Downgrade Version: The error or the version the HTTP server downgrades the request to\n\n*Note: \"Vulnerable\" in this context means that it is confirmed that an attacker can reset the a stream connection without issue, it does not take into account implementation-specific or volume-based detections*",
